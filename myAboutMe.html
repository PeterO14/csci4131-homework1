        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! I'm Peter Ortiz. I am currently pursuing a bachelors of science in Computer
            Science at the University of Minnesota. This Fall I am also working part-time as a
            Software Development Intern at Code42, a cyber security company headquartered in 
            Minneapolis, MN.

            The most recent book I read is titled <em>Cloud Cuckoo Land</em>. It is a story that
            follows the lives of adventures of Omeir, Anna, Zeno, Seymour, and Konstance over
            thousands of years. As the story unfolds, we begin to see how each of their stories
            are connected in one wy or another to an ancient text written by Antonio Diogene. His
            tale, written to his dying neice in an effort to alleviate her suffering is an
            adventure unlike no other. The overarching themes of fate, love, and a longing for
            what is beyond define this story and make it impossible to put down.

            What I found most interesting about this chapter is Ebbinghaus’s findings that offered
            support for the frequency principle. Ebbinghaus found that <strong>continuing to study 
            a list beyond the point of mastery, in his case 10 to 20 further repetitions, the 
            savings after 24 hours showed a substantial increase</strong>. This practice, of
            continuing to practice after a perfect performance, has been dubbed Overlearning.
            Ebbinghaus goes further to demonstrate that Thomas Brown’s principle of frequency,
            stating that the frequency of pairings affects the strength of an association, is 
            applicable to periods of overlearning as well as periods that show improvement during
            practice.
